# Roadmap: remote MCP and integrations

## Current security boundary
- Local MCP is available via stdio. The remote Streamable HTTP endpoint is deployed on Render Free and protected by Auth0 OAuth.
- `/mcp` requires an RS256 token with the correct issuer, audience, lifetime and `mcp:tools` scope.
- `/health` and RFC 9728 protected-resource metadata are intentionally public.
- No API keys, tokens or passwords should be committed to this public repository.
- The local catalogue/manifest is not a cloud database. Treat its contents as private.
- Files are not uploaded to Suno or DistroKid by this project.

## Remote deployment status
1. [x] Publish the Streamable HTTP endpoint over HTTPS on Render Free.
2. [x] Implement Auth0 discovery, protected-resource metadata and JWT validation.
3. [x] Require authorization for every MCP request.
4. [x] Test the local MCP protocol and the public authentication boundary.
5. [ ] Register the connector in ChatGPT and complete the first interactive login and tool call.
6. [ ] Add durable storage and rate limiting before storing important or multi-user data.

## Provider integrations
DistroKid: do not assume an official release-upload API exists. Keep publishing as a manual approval step unless a supported authorized integration is confirmed.

## Verification
Offline tests cover syntax, OAuth validation and MCP routing. Live checks cover the Render health, metadata and unauthorized boundary. They do not test a real DistroKid account, a completed ChatGPT login or publication.
