# Auth0 OAuth implementation

The remote server validates Auth0-issued RS256 access tokens. `/health` and the RFC 9728 protected-resource metadata routes are public; `/mcp` requires a token for this server's audience with the `mcp:tools` scope.

## Implemented

- Auth0 supplies Authorization Code + PKCE and authorization-server discovery.
- The server validates issuer, audience, expiration and RS256 signatures from Auth0 JWKS.
- The server requires `mcp:tools` from the token's `scope` or `permissions` claims.
- Unauthorized requests return a Bearer challenge pointing to protected-resource metadata.
- No Auth0 client secret is stored in this resource server.

## Tenant and deployment status

- Auth0's Resource Parameter Compatibility Profile is enabled.
- The ChatGPT OAuth client is separate from this API resource and uses the official callback.
- The client allows Authorization Code and Refresh Token grants; Implicit and Client Credentials are disabled.
- The OAuth build is deployed on Render Free and its metadata plus unauthorized responses have been checked live.
- Never log or commit client secrets, codes, refresh tokens or private user content.
- Register the endpoint in ChatGPT and complete an interactive login plus MCP tool test before calling the integration production-ready.

## Current limitations

- Render Free may sleep and lose local files after restart or redeployment.
- The tools do not access DistroKid accounts or unofficial DistroKid APIs.
- A successful `/health` response is not proof that OAuth or MCP tools work.
